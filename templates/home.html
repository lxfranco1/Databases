      <p class="ex1"style="text-decoration: underline;"><font size="+2">What is the Twitter Analyzer?</font></p>
        <p class="ex1">Twitter is widely known as a system for users to express public opinion, and can somewhat reflect the general
          <br>
      standing of a topic if analyzed thoroughly.
        The Twitter Analyzer seeks to analyze this user data and express the exact level of <br>influence and
       scope of spread a tweet has attained in ways that remain
        quite unclear when observed through normal channels</p>

      <p><br></p>
      <p class="ex1" style="text-decoration: underline;"><font size="+2">What are it's applications?</font></p>
      <p class="ex1">A big question regarding information spreading across twitter is just how far the influence of this
      information has travelled. For example, <br>many politicians question how far campaign messages travel, and whom they travel to. The twitter
        analyzer will break down this<br>information, albeit on a smaller scale, and break down the information, store it to a database, and
      readily query the information for the users viewing pleasure.</p>
